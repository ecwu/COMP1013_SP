	- read a sequence of integers in an array a
	  - (assume that the total number of integers is less than 20)
	- inverse the numbers in the array a.

	For example:
	input are 10, 20, 30, 40. 
	output is 40, 30, 20, 10.

	- Requirements
	  - The main function will be responsible for inputting and outputting integers.
	  - The sub-function inverse will be responsible for inversing the integers in an array.
